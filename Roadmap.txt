        name: 'Brittany Combs'
        into: ['one', 'two', 'three']
        messages: [Message, ...]
        upto: [Post, Post, ...]
        about: "..."
        photos: 4
    }

    {
        id: Id
        person: Person
        time: Date
        comments: [Comment, Comment, ...]
        location: ['Pangea', [12.2121, 4.4313]]

    {
        id: Id,
        person: Person
        post: Post.id
        time: Date
        text: "..."

    {

        to: Person.id
        text: "..."

    }







fun:
Gray out sign in button once pressed

fix:
    sometimes returning to view stops reporting slides? (actionbar / pageslider don't update)
    double tap profile leads into outerspace
    signin button doesn't work 1st time



maybe:
